This repository accompanies the "Build Ethereum From Scratch - Smart Contracts and More".

In this repository, you will build your own version of Ethereum. Ethereum can be described in two words. It's a:

#### Decentralized Computer.

A decentralized computer is like a normal computer. A normal computer executes a program using one machine.

But a decentralized computer executes a program using multiple machines. Every machine needs to agree upon the output of the program for its results to become official.

To build a decentralized computer, here are the essential elements:

1) A smart contract language.
2) A blockchain.
3) A network.
4) Transactions and accounts.
5) A state management data structure.

Definitely build this project if you're interested in exploring the concepts behind this project more deeply. The repository is a line-by-line tutorial of this entire program. And by the end of building this program, you'll have your own version of Ethereum.
